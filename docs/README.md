# 📗 About

Sprout :seedling: originates as **a fork** from [Sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which laid the foundation for this project. Initially, Sprout was created to update dependencies and introduce new functions.&#x20;

After observing two years of inactivity on the main repository, we decided to take a proactive approach. **Sprout has evolved from Sprig** with the goal of being more responsive to dependency updates and the delivery of new functionalities.&#x20;

Our aim is to foster a dynamic and collaborative development environment, welcoming contributions and suggestions to enhance our project.

> :seedling: In the heart of spring, a tiny seed in the soil awakened. With each passing day, it stretched towards the sun, a whisper of green emerging from the earth. As spring's embrace warmed the ground, the seed shed its shell, eager to greet the world. In a burst of determination and growth, what was once a humble seedling proudly stood as a sprout, ready for the journey ahead.
