# About

Sprout :seedling: originates as **a fork** from [Sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which laid the foundation for this project. Initially, Sprout was created to update dependencies and introduce new functions.

After observing two years of inactivity on the main repository, we decided to take a proactive approach. **Sprout has evolved from Sprig** with the goal of being more responsive to dependency updates and the delivery of new functionalities.

Our aim is to foster a dynamic and collaborative development environment, welcoming contributions and suggestions to enhance our project.

> :seedling: In the heart of spring, a tiny seed in the soil awakened. With each passing day, it stretched towards the sun, a whisper of green emerging from the earth. As spring's embrace warmed the ground, the seed shed its shell, eager to greet the world. In a burst of determination and growth, what was once a humble seedling proudly stood as a sprout, ready for the journey ahead.

This document will help contributors and maintainers understand the modifications made between the fork date and version 1.0.0 of the Sprout library.
