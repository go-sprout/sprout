/**
 * This file lists the functions originally part of the Sprig library that are
 * intentionally excluded from the Sprout library. The exclusions are based on\
 * community decisions and technical evaluations aimed at enhancing security,
 * relevance, and performance in the context of Go templates.
 * Each exclusion is supported by rational and further community discussions
 * can be found on our GitHub issues page.
 *
 * Exclusion Criteria:
 * 1. Crypto functions: Deemed inappropriate for Go templates due to inherent security risks.
 * 2. Irrelevant functions: Omitted because they do not provide utility in the context of Go templates.
 * 3. Deprecated/Insecure: Functions using outdated or insecure standards are excluded.
 * 4. Temporary exclusions: Certain functions are temporarily excluded to prevent breaking changes,
 *    pending the implementation of the new loader feature.
 * 5. Community decision: Choices made by the community are documented and can be discussed at
 *    https://github.com/go-sprout/sprout/issues/1.
 *
 * The Sprout library is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community.
 * To discuss existing exclusions or propose new ones, please contribute to the discussions on
 * our GitHub repository.
